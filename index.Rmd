_Prove for the following statement using course resources such as our notes and textbooks. Your proof should be your own work, so you should not use any other resources. Record a short presentation or create a slideshow explaining your proof. Make sure that you clearly state any definitions, axioms, or theorems that you are using._

# Suppose _R_ is a non-square rhombus.

1. List the symmetries of R. Write as a composition of translations, reflections, and rotations. 

2. Prove that the set of symmetries of _R_ is a group under composition.
